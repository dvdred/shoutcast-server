<a name="700"></a><h3>2.4.8 Build 700</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n" id="first" style="margin-left:180px;">
<li>Added FLV containerisation support for MP3 and AAC streams (add ?type=.flv to compatible stream urls to use)</li>
<li>Added support for sending title updates to Tunein for DNAS+ streams</li>
<li>Added 'minbitrate' and 'streamminbitrate' options to complement the 'maxbitrate' and 'streammaxbitrate' options</li>
<li>Added 'streambitrate' alias for setting both 'streammaxbitrate' and 'streamminbitrate' to enforce a single allowed bitrate</li>
<li>Added the HTML5 player to /index.html?sid=0 page for all compatible streams (currently only MP3 streams)</li>
<li>Added 'type=x' parameter to force specific connection handling (e.g. type=http or type=.flv or type=sc1 or type=sc2 or type=html) irrespective of what the connection may indicate from header and user-agent values)</li>
<li>Added unlimited listener support when setting 'maxuser=0' to allow any listener connection (the server will still need to be able to support the number of requests when this is enabled to avoid streaming issues)</li>
<li>Added frame syncing support on all source inputs (direct and relay) to filter out bad stream data</li>
<li>Added 'dns' mappings of the 'ip' config options (e.g. publicdns -> publicip)</li>
<li>Added modes to enable / disable only the source and only the listener debugging options via mode=debug?option=source and mode=debug?option=listener respectively</li>
<li>Added StreamNext='xxx' to the SHOUTcast 1.x-style in-stream title updates (will need listener software updates to be able to make use of this)</li>
<li>Added samplerate reporting on the appropriate stream pages and log output</li>
<li>Added rate limiting on all listener handlers to help reduce listeners getting too far ahead or adverts being resumed from at the in-correct position (or playing the filler as well as the adverts)</li>
<li>Added 'ratelimit' to enable control of the frame rate limiting feature (set ratelimit=0 to disable if it causes issues)</li>
<li>Added 'adtestfile', 'adtestfileloop', 'streamadtestfile', 'streamadtestfileloop', and related handling to aid in testing advert triggers will work (see documentation for details)</li>
<li>Added 'adminfile' support which allows for restricting unwanted access to admin.cgi to only valid IP / hostnames added intto the 'sc_serv.admin' file (see documentation for details)</li>
<li>Added 'forceshortsends' support which allows for mimicking restricted network output which can occassionally be helpful for debugging</li>
<li>Added 'adminnowrap' support to allow for disabling some of the mobile friendly CSS / HTML changes for the stream admin page and its display of the listener list</li>
<li>Added a sanitised configuration settings view mode for the server administrator to aid in checking that the DNAS is using the settings it is meant to be using</li>
<li>Added /currentmetadata?sid=# which is a more accessible version of the admin.cgi mode=viewxml or mode=viewjson and page=5 requests for getting the extended stream metadata</li>
<li>Added support to make better use of the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header (use usexff=0 to disable this change) which is helpful if all listeners appear to be connected from the local machine due to front-facing services</li>
<li>Added proper handling of HTTP HEAD requests to resolve a number of issues with unexpected listener connections and failed source connections</li>
<li>Added a 'kick duplicates' option to the stream administrator page to make it easier to kick duplicate connections from the same user agent and address (see documentation for how to use this in a script)</li>
<li>Added support for direct HTTP sources (e.g. Icecast based sources) to be accepted when providing MP3 and AAC based stream content)</li>
<li>Added support for SHOUTcast 1.x sources to be accepted on 'portbase' and not 'portbase+1' as per the SHOUTcast 1.x protocol specification which makes it possible for all sources (1.x and 2.x) to be accepted on a single port instead of needing two ports (see documentation for details and limitations of this mode)<br><br></li>

<li>Changed authhash management to improve integration with the Radionomy platform and services now being offered for SHOUTcast broadcasters</li>
<li>Changed the default CSS / HTML output to adjustements to work better on mobile devices / small screens including consolidating and removing some of the information on the summary pages</li>
<li>Changed the YP update to be able to do a full re-add of the stream on update incase of YP-side issues on add</li>
<li>Changed the YP update handling to be more dynamic to aid with remote clustering fixes</li>
<li>Changed to use a new scheduler which allows the server to be more flexible and allows the rate limiting support to work correctly</li>
<li>Changed to require a key press if running normally (non-daemon and non-service modes) when a major issue occurs of the server cannot be run</li>
<li>Changed 1.x source handling to check the password earlier in the connection steps which allows for quicker checking and setup of the source or rejection as applicable</li>

<li>Changed the tailing mode to match the 1.x DNAS so it will now only show the log output from when opening the tailing view</li>
<li>Changed title update to clarify why certain title updates are being rejected</li>
<li>Changed the way that advert triggers are detected and processed to increase the reliability of advert triggers being actioned</li>
<li>Changed some of the page icons to appear more visible on dark backgrounds</li>
<li>Changed log output to only show 'Terminating listeners...' if there are listeners</li>

<li>Changed applicable timeout handling to go through a common handler which now ensures that per-stream overrides on the timeouts are correctly applied</li>
<li>Changed to indicate CDN mode on backup relay connections</li>
<li>Changed the internal handling of the config items to better handle large stream ids so as to save memory if not using sequential streamids (which speeds up config handling as well as potentially saving a lot of memory)</li>
<li>Changed to check and abort starting the DNAS if no source passwords are specified</li>
<li>Changed some of the log start-up wording messages</li>
<li>Changed the Flash Policy Server to generate the response immediately to reduce time to provide a response</li>
<li>Changed to not check for &lt;policy-file-request/&gt; if the Flash Policy Server is not enabled on the port</li>

<li>Changed to show the bitrate of the skipped files to help with diagnosing why a file was skipped</li>
<li>Changed handling of relay and direct 1.x sources to improve consistency between them and reduce the time to start a relay connection</li>
<li>Changed the 2.x relay handling to reduce time to setup the relay connection as well as reducing memory for the connection setup</li>
<li>Changed file / advert checking to also check the samplerate to improve reliabity of file / advert inserts</li>
<li>Changed the stream login / logout options to have 'Stream' in front of them to make it clearer vs the main Server actions</li>
<li>Changed to look for SSLv2 / SSLv3 / TLSv1.x connections and abort them as we do not support HTTPS connections and this was causing false source connection attempts</li>
<li>Changed debugging output to make it easier to see the full filepath of the control files being used</li>
<li>Changed when the YP 'add' is issued to prevent it spamming the metrics system if the connnection quickly fails (e.g. when running a relay that cannot connect to the source)</li>
<li>Changed SHOUTcast 1.x and HTTP listener connection handling to be done separately which allows us to provide an optimised HTTP experience than the prior shared handling</li>

<li>Changed the ultravox creation to reduce the processing overhead when creating such data</li>
<li>Changed admin.cgi?mode=history to provide XML and JSON responses like the /played(.html) method can provide</li>
<li>Changed to ignore empty icy-icq, icy-irc and icy-aim headers which some older sources send and which could cause the source to be incorrectly rejected</li>
<li>Changed to allow empty icy-url headers to improve legacy source connection support</li>
<li>Changed the stream admin page to load the current listener list asynchronously instead of waiting for all of the details to load at once</li>
<li>Changed the HTML5 player on the DNAS pages to force http mode</li>
<li>Changed the HTML5 player on the DNAS pages to be hidden if the browser being used does not support such playback of the stream(s)</li>
<li>Changed to use HTTPS for all communication the DNAS needs to make</li>
<li>Changed to show the user agent in the banned connection log messages</li>
<li>Changed to not save 'streamid' when re-writing or editing the config file as the DNAS is able to work this out without needing the option to be present (unlike with older 2.x releases)</li>

<p><br></p>

<a name="167"></a><h3>2.4.2 Build 167 / 168</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>Fixed issues with not finding cacert.pem in the same location as the DNAS program file which was preventing YP connectivity working (2.4.1 build 164 specific)</li>
<li>Fixed broken relative config file handling not working correctly with init scripts and 3rd party control panels (2.4.1 build 165 specific)<br><br></li>

<li>Changed some of the log and admin page output to better show the actual filepath being used for log and configuration files (helpful for determining path loading issues)</li>
<li>Changed handling incase the cacert.pem file cannot be found to be more forgiving for the time being (futher changes will follow in later builds)<br><br></li>

<li>Removed 'Error writing to console' log messages when <b>screenlog=1</b> (default) and the shell the DNAS was started in is closed whilst the DNAS is still running e.g. due to OS defined timeouts - always use <b>screenlog=0</b> if running the DNAS and you do not need it sending log output to the console</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="165"></a><h3>2.4.1 Build 164 / 165</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>Added features relating to the 'DNAS+ for CDN' streaming solution<br><br></li>
<li>Added ability to preserve the peak listener numbers for a stream between DNAS sessions e.g. when updating the DNAS (subject to conditions) - this requires the stream being publically listed and will be disabled if found to be abused!</li>
<li>Added <u>experimental</u> support to allow streams using 1.x source clients to be able to provide stream branding artwork via 'artworkfile' and 'streamartworkfile' configuration options (this enables basic stream branding artwork support for legacy 1.x based streams subject to client support [as below] - for 2.x based streams, the source should already have the ability to provide the stream branding and now playing artwork)</li>
<li>Added ability to provide artwork to 1.x clients via the legacy in-stream metadata system when provided from a 2.x source or when using the experimental support mentioned above (subject to clients supporting this feature - see the wiki for more information)</li>
<li>Added 'email' configuration option so hosts can provide a generic contact address (which is used during authhash creation / updates if not manually specified)<br><br></li>

<li>Changed YP connections to use HTTPS - this means a valid cacert.pem <u>must</u> be present in the same folder as the DNAS program file otherwise the DNAS cannot list streams</li>
<li>Changed file permission defaults on non-Windows builds to be more consistent between the different APIs internally used for files created by the DNAS</li>
<li>Changed the update notifications to provide extra information where possible about the update<br><br></li>

<li>Fixed YP connectivity issues introduced during the change over to using libcurl in the 2.2.2 / 2.4 releases e.g. randomly stops updating or prevents the DNAS from being able to close correctly or does not correctly handle cases when the YP is not contactable</li>
<li>Fixed handling of custom streampaths with parameters (starting with /; or ;) always providing stream #1 (using /stream/x/ did not experience this issue)</li>
<li>Fixed rare issue leading to high CPU usage when using a single core non-Windows system</li>
<li>Fixed rare crash when accessing some of the admin pages on non-Windows builds</li>
<li>Fixed some IP formatting issues on the admin pages<br><br></li>

<li>Removed remaining ICY support so all client connections are now via standard HTTP requets as 2.4 did (ICY was a HTTP-like protocol)</li>
<li>Removed the 'disableicy' configuration option for controlling this support (not needed due to the prior change)<br><br></li>

<li>Updated to support newer YP requirements for authhash handling and listing modes as well as related tweaks to the authhash management pages</li>
<li>Updated to OpenSSL v1.0.1j<br><br></li>

<li>Return of the BSD 8.x build<br><br></li>

<li>Other miscellaneous code changes, improvments and related documentation updates (including handling immediate segfaults on start-up)</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="147"></a><h3>2.4.0 Build 147</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>Added support for the Radionomy advert and metrics platforms so you can earn money from overlaying some adverts on the stream and / or leveraging the online broadcasting tools from Radionomy (this is an opt-in feature and requires a Radionomy account - it does not prevent you using the DNAS like before)<br><br></li>

<li>Added 'publicip' to be used to specify a DNS / IP value to use for what the YP will see as your server address when 'destip' is used for binding against a non-public value e.g. anything in the loopback address range (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added 'alternateports' which can be used to allow for client only connections on port(s) other than 'portbase' e.g. to deal with firewalls blocking client access on some networks</li>
<li>Added 'disableicy' to the options handled by the configuration reload action</li>
<li>Added 'rotateinterval' to allow for changing the time between automatic log rotations (default is 24 hours) and can be set to 0 to disable log rotation completely</li>
<li>Added basic command-line help into the DNAS itself (use /? or --help) which is based on the OS version being used without the need to consult the main documentation</li>
<li>Added better handling of the intro and backup files to ensure they match the stream format and will now reject files which do not match the bitrate<br><br></li>

<li>Changed 'disableicy=1' handling (default behaviour since 2.2.2) to allow 1.x clients which explicitly request in-stream metadata to still receive it e.g. VLC and foobar2000<br><br></li>

<li>Fixed crash when rotating the log and w3c files (this was mainly seen under Centova Cast installs) and some other log file handling refinements</li>
<li>Fixed authhash issues specific to the 2.2.2 release (mainly seen as a 462 error code when trying to use the management actions)</li>
<li>Fixed handling of unrecognised loopback addresses causing incorrect addresses in some of the DNAS responses e.g. the listen.* methods</li>
<li>Fixed MP3 intro files breaking stream playback (such as causing stuttering or just not playing anything else) when transitioning to the actual audio stream e.g. most Flash based players (this is an issue going all the way back to the v1.x DNAS!)</li>
<li>Fixed MP3 streams not starting on a full audio frame (this should improve client compatibility, more so with Flash based players)
<li>Fixed the 'Block User Agent' column on the stream admin page not showing the correct action (it could be shown in the 'Reserve Client' in some cases)</li>
<li>Fixed repeated admin login prompt when trying to manage an authhash in some cases (mainly if having per-stream admin passwords)<br><br></li>

<li>Removed specific handling for the deprecated AOL shoutcast.com site / embeddable Flash player (that specific player is no longer officially supported hence removing support for it)<br><br></li>

<li>Other miscellaneous code changes, improvments and related documentation updates</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<a name="123"></a><h3>2.2.2 Build 123</h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>The first Radionomy provided SHOUTcast DNAS release after the sale of SHOUTcast (and Winamp) in January 2014</li>
<li>This is primarily a maintenance release to resolve issues and broadcaster requests with the 2.2.x DNAS since the last build provided under AOL ownership<br><br></li>
<li>Added 'pidfile' option to control the creation of the file containing the process id of the DNAS (this defaults to creating 'sc_serv_&lt;portbase&gt;.pid if not specified in the same folder as the DNAS)</li>
<li>Added ability to block user agents from connecting to the streams on a global and per-stream basis if required (via admin pages and admin api methods)</li>
<li>Added 'agentfile', 'streamagentfile' and 'saveagentlistonexit' configuration options to allow for where and how the sc_serv.agent file is stored (which is used for holding the blocked user agents)</li>
<li>Added 'blockemptyuseragent' configuration option to allow for preventing client connections without a user agent from connecting (note: some valid clients e.g. some hardware devices may not provide a user agent and enabling this may incorrectly block legitimate client connections)</li>
<li>Added 'Reload Banned List(s)' option to the server admin page to complement the 'Reload Reserved List(s)' option<br><br></li>

<li>Changed network handling on non-Windows builds to try to resolve the random crashes with large listener numbers and scale better (e.g. going over ~330 concurrent listeners)</li>
<li>Changed to use libcurl instead of a custom library for all YP requests to help resolve the YP connection reliability issues some users have seen with most of the 2.x releases</li>
<li>Changed 'disableicy' default from '0' to '1' so we now by default provide HTTP instead of ICY headers - this resolves all known HTML5 audio playback access issues</li>
<li>Changed the frequency and formatting of some of the log output</li>
<li>Changed 'unique' to also apply to the 'portbase' config option</li>
<li>Changed log file creation to use sc_serv_&lt;pid&gt;.log (where &lt;pid&gt; is the process id of the DNAS) if the default / fallback 'sc_serv.log' cannot be created e.g. due to file permissions creating / accessing an existing copy of the file (mainly affects non-Windows builds)</li>
<li>Changed 'maxuser' default from 32 to 512 listeners (you will need to ensure the OS can support this e.g. adjusting ulimit -n on non-Windows installs)</li>
<li>Changed 'relayreconnecttime' default from 30 to 5 seconds (based on usage feedback)</li>
<li>Changed 'adaptivebuffersize' default from 5 to 10 seconds (based on usage feedback)</li>
<li>Changed GCC version used to build the Linux / Raspberry Pi versions (now using GCC 4.7.2 instead of GCC 4.4.6 / 4.6.3 respectively)</li>
<li>Changed title update handling in respect to issues related to CVE-2014-4166 (which we were not informed about before it was disclosed!)<br><br></li>

<li>Fixed stream access issues (always providing stream #1) if streampath=/stream is set and providing multiple streams from the same DNAS</li>
<li>Fixed formatting error in the JSON version of the listener details (XML version was not affected)</li>
<li>Fixed some file handle leaks with log file handling (mainly happened when compressing older log files on rotation)</li>
<li>Fixed a number of YP error handling issues (mainly found from changing over to use libcurl) e.g. stuck on 'Processing...' when an error was logged</li>
<li>Fixed the 'city' value of the authhash not being correctly re-loaded when viewing the authhash<br><br></li>

<li>Other miscellaneous code changes, improvments and related documentation updates</li>

<a name="109"></a><h3>2.2.1 Build 109 <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>Completed remaining 1.x compatibility improvements (specifically relating to YP availability issues so clients are now only blocked from connecting if there is no source connected)<br><br></li>

<li>Added experimental 'streamportlegacy' option to allow for supporting more than one direct legacy 1.x source connection to the server (see documentation for usage / limitations)<br><br></li>

<li>Changed Windows service install / uninstall messages when UAC elevation / admin access is required to undertake the action<br><br></li>

<li>Fixed issues due to a bug in the handling of the 'useicy' option which is now deprecated and replaced by the 'disableicy' option (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Fixed reported issues with the 'Source Login Details' page (mainly showing mode availability incorrectly)</li>
<li>Fixed missing 'UID' value for client disconnects in the main log output</li>
<li>Fixed some clients being incorrectly shown as 'HTML5' client types when they were not on the admin pages</li>
<li>Fixed compile issues preventing the BSD build from being built for the prior release<br><br></li>

<a name="107"></a><h3>2.2.0 Build 107 <a style="font-size:55%;" href="#">[top]</a></h3>
<hr>
<ul class="n">
<li>Added a 'setup' mode which allows basic configuration of the server when run without a configuration file (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added a 'builder' mode which allows for the configuration builder to be run within the server (broadcasting is disabled in this mode)</li>
<li>Added automatic authhash generation when a stream source is connected on a public stream and an authhash was not already present (can be disabled using autoauthhash=0)</li>
<li>Added /statistics which consolidates all of the /stats?sid=# results for all known and active streams</li>
<li>Added 'flashpolicyserverport' allowing the DNAS to serve up the Flash policy file (as per 'flashpolicyfile') on port 843 or a custom port (as well as on 'portbase')</li>
<li>Added serving of 'shoutcast.swf' for custom flash players to be handled in the same domain as the server (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added listen.xspf and listen.qtl to the /listen* playlist options available (so now pls, m3u, asx, qtl and xspf are available on a stream)</li>
<li>Added 'portlegacy' to allow changing or disabling the port legacy 1.x sources connect on (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added 'publicport' to allow changing the port reported to the YP servers and any clients using the /listen.* playlists where 'portbase' is not the port externally seen</li>
<li>Added option on 'Server Summary' page (accessed from admin.cgi?sid=0) to allow for manually setting the stream authhash e.g. if needed for a relay</li>
<li>Added 'Stream DJ' (if known) on the stream admin pages as well as &lt;DJ/&gt; in all statistics for getting the current DJ of the connected source (more formal specification than fiddling the IRC / AIM / ICQ values as used with 1.x DNAS setups)</li>
<li>Added 'streammaxbitrate' and 'maxbitrate' options for per-stream or global limiting of the source bitrate allowed for a connection</li>
<li>Added 'streambackupurl' option for per-stream fallback if the original source (direct or via a relay) fails to keep the stream alive (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added server bandwidth usage reporting for the server administrator via the admin.cgi?mode=bandwidth action (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added JSON and JSON-P responses to the /stats?sid=# and /statistics responses by appending &amp;json=1 for JSON and appending &amp;callback=&lt;function&gt; for JSON-P</li>
<li>Added XML, JSON and JSON-P support to the /played response as well as to support &amp;pass to allow song history access to the XML, JSON and JSON-P responses even when public display of them is disabled</li>
<li>Added admin.cgi?mode=viewjson as a JSON and JSON-P equivalent of admin.cgi?mode=viewxml (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added ability to kick all connected clients on a stream via the stream admin summary page in addition to the existing single client kicking</li>
<li>Added 'redirecturl', 'streamredirecturl' and 'streamhidestats' options for per-stream or global redirection / blocking of publically accessible pages when 'hidestats' or the new 'streamhidestats' options are enabled</li>
<li>Added SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 support in non-Windows builds for reloading the configuration file from the console (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added SIGWINCH support in non-Windows builds for reloading the Reserved IP file(s) from the console (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added support for GZIP (RFC 1952) encoding of appropriate page and data responses if supported by the requesting connection and will provide a bandwidth saving</li>
<li>Added a 'View Source Login Details' page to the server summary page to make it easier to get the login details required for all appropriate stream configurations</li>
<li>Added sp=&lt;streampath&gt; support to all web methods which support sid=&lt;streamid&gt; to be able to access a page by streampath instead of streamid - streamid is still the preferred method (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added 'admin.cgi?mode=viewlog&amp;viewlog=save' method to allow for downloading the server log output as a GZIP compressed archive (useful for checking the log output remotely or for support issues)</li>
<li>Added 'streammovedurl' option for per-stream redirection of permanently stopped or moved streams from the server</li>
<li>Added archiving of log, w3c and streamw3c files when rotating these files would cause them to be deleted (which happens when there are usually five rotated copies already)</li>
<li>Added 'logrotates' and 'logbackup' options to provide finer control over the rotation (default of 5 files) and backup (default off) of the log files during rotations</li>
<li>Added icy=http parameter detection on 1.x client connections to return a HTTP instead of a ICY header response type e.g. server:port/?icy=http</li>
<li>Added 'url' parameter to the 'updinfo' action to replicate 1.x DNAS functionality which had not been re-implemented in the 2.x DNAS</li>
<li>Added 'dj' parameter to the 'updinfo' action to allow for scripted updating of the 'DJ' reported for a stream (useful for legacy source software)</li>
<li>Added 'ypstatus' method for the server administrator via the admin.cgi?mode=ypstatus action (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Added reporting of the stationid for public listings on the server and stream administrator pages</li>
<li>Added 'streamuptime' to the /stats and /statistic responses to aid in monitoring of the length of source connections to the server</li>
<li>Added /streamart?sid=# and /playingart?sid=# methods as a public version of the verions viewable via 'admin.cgi?mode=art&amp;sid=#'</li>
<li>Added back /7(.html) support due to issues in getting legacy reporting tools updated to support the recommended 'stats' methods</li>
<li>Added admin.cgi?mode=history as an admin page equivalent of played.html?sid=# so stream administrators can easily see the played history of the stream</li>
<li>Added 'useicy' option to control if the DNAS will provide ICY (default) or HTTP (HTML5 compatible) headers for client connections<br><br></li>

<li>Improved YP interaction when the IP address of the DNAS changes whilst it is still broadcasting (requires YP update for this to work fully)</li>
<li>Improved handling of source relay connections especially via the server's admin pages e.g. a pending source relay connection can be aborted</li>
<li>Improved handling with large client numbers to reduce CPU usage as well as not crashing when exhausting the imposed maximum file descriptors (e.g. ulimit -n)<br><br></li>

<li>Changed 'streampath' to default to / for streamid=1 to improve compatibility (/stream/&lt;sid&gt;/ is still default on all other streams)</li>
<li>Changed config file handling to automatically use 'sc_serv.ini' or 'sc_serv.conf' if present if no config file is specified (better replicates 1.x DNAS behaviour)</li>
<li>Changed relayconnectretries to accept zero (relayconnectretries=0) to keep trying to reconnect to the relay source and changed the default to 0 from 3</li>
<li>Changed reporting of the YP connection state on the admin pages to make it clearer if the authhash is invalid or empty</li>
<li>Changed the 'Stream Configurations' xml response to fill &lt;STREAMAUTHHASH/&gt; with EMPTY or INVALID on error as applicable</li>
<li>Changed YP2 connection attempts to not be made if the authhash is determined to be invalid or empty</li>
<li>Changed 'hidestats' to allow for more control over the pages which are able to be disabled (see documentation for usage)</li>
<li>Changed 'updinfo' to not need 'type=xml' as it now auto-detects how to process the title information received</li>
<li>Changed 'configrewrite' to accept 'configrewrite=2' so now 'configrewrite=1' generates minimal configurations (only saves values not at the default) and 'configrewrite=2' outputs all configuration options (like 'configrewrite=1' used to do)</li>
<li>Changed YP2 handling to show the stream number, outputting of detailed error messages (where provided) and not output /yp/resp/updatefreq errors</li>
<li>Changed handling of the SHOUTcast site player client connections to not send in-stream metadata to workaround issues with title changes</li>
<li>Changed song history and current song titles shown in any reports to use the pre-formatted title from the source if available (does not change titles in clients)</li>

<li>Changed SHOUTcast 2 source logging to only output complete metadata and connection details when using uvox2sourcedebug=1 (instead of always as before) </li>
<li>Changed all /listen* playlist options to output the 'backupserver' provided by the YP where possible</li>
<li>Changed some of the server and stream admin page header links to better hide invalid options and to make navigation easier, etc</li>
<li>Changed the configuration reload option ('admin.cgi?mode=reload' on the 'Server Summary' page) to also update the debugging options and other options (see documentation for additions)</li>
<li>Changed Reserved IP handling to allow connections from 127.0.0.1 through even if not specified (allows access to admin pages)</li>
<li>Changed the Ban and Reserve IP administration actions to save changes (if enabled) at the time instead of only on exit</li>
<li>Changed YP2 stream registration to wait until the source has provided a title to allow the station listing to appear sooner (requires YP update for this to work fully)</li>
<li>Changed handling of authhash changes via the update option to update the current stream information without requiring the stream(s) to be restarted</li>
<li>Changed server summary page to count inactive relay configurations (if correctly specified) as available streams so it is possible to restart them easier</li>
<li>Changed the user agent (mainly for relay connections) to now be 'Ultravox/2.1 SHOUTcast Server x.x.x.x' (where x.x.x.x is the version and build numbers)</li>
<li>Changed the stream admin page to also report the type (1.x or 2.x) of the connected clients</li>
<li>Changed the current listener list on the admin summary page (admin.cgi?sid=#) to group client connections from the same IP address (make non-unique connections easier to find)</li>
<li>Changed all /listen.* handling to use the public IP of the DNAS as reported by the YP when publically listed (requires YP update for this to work fully)</li>
<li>Changed 'flashpolicyfile' handling to use an internal copy if a custom file is not specified (which has the benefit of specifying the actual ports used)</li>
<li>Changed console output to highlight errors in red, warnings in yellow and debug output in green to make them more obvious (cannot be disabled)</li>
<li>Changed the 'view logfile' administration pages to highlight errors, warnings and debug output to make them more obvious (colours can be changed via css)</li>
<li>Changed /stats?sid=# to support &amp;pass to allow stats access even when public display of them is disabled</li>
<li>Changed Windows builds to only send warning and error messages to the event log in service mode or if a critical error happens on startup before file logging occurs</li>
<li>Changed autodumpsourcetime and streamautodumpsourcetime to be known as autodumptime and streamautodumptime respectively to better reflect the general usage of these options</li>
<li>Changed server summary page to display configured but non-running configurations along with active sources and inactive relay configurations</li>
<li>Changed 'yptimeout' default from 60 to 30 seconds</li>
<li>Changed 'Shoutcast Metadata Puller' handling to only return the title update (if enabled) instead of the audio data to help save bandwidth on popular listed streams</li>
<li>Changed GCC version used to build the Linux versions (now using GCC 4.4.6 instead of GCC 4.1.2 from CentOS 5.8)</li>
<li>Changed 'admin.cgi?sid=#&amp;mode=kickdst' to support IP address(s) in addition to the existing unique client id(s) support<br><br></li>

<li>Fixed connection issues with YP directory listings when no 'streampath' is specifed (now ensures /stream/&lt;sid&gt;/ is set as the path so connections will be made against the correct stream)</li>
<li>Fixed some client connection issues when 'streampath' has been specifed (could lead to sid=1 being played even if the streampath_2 was attempted)</li>
<li>Fixed non-english title compatibility with 1.x sources i.e. titles with accented characters, was leading to title issues (also affected legacy DNAS builds)</li>
